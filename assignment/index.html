I am a graduate of Landmark University, where I earned a Second Class Upper Division degree in Accounting, and a certified ATSWA holder (Accounting Technicians Scheme West Africa). I am currently at the Skills Level of my professional accounting journey, actively working toward becoming a Chartered Accountant. My expertise spans financial reporting, budgeting, taxation, auditing, compliance, and performance analysis, with a strong focus on accuracy, accountability, and value-driven decision-making.</p>
        
            <p>Beyond accounting, I am an early-stage website developer with a growing interest in leveraging technology to solve real-world challenges and improve business systems. I am particularly passionate about transforming Nigeria’s real estate sector by integrating financial intelligence, transparency, and digital innovation into property management and investment structures. I am highly disciplined, hardworking, and detail-oriented, with a strong ethical mindset, excellent communication skills, and proven leadership ability. Fluent in English and effective in collaborative environments, I thrive in roles that require responsibility, strategic thinking, and teamwork.
